# Boogie Manager

A package for music nerds who still have a large music library stored on their hard drive.

* **Generalise** Mutagen's tagging operations across three file types (MP3, MP4 and FLAC) so you don't have to look up the specific syntax every time
* Perform **batch tagging operations** on all files in a certain folder
* Easily **collect and analyse data** about your music library

Dependencies (outside of Python standard library): matplotlib, mutagen, pandas, numpy

Project status: code itself more or less done; some functions still need more commenting; readme under construction
